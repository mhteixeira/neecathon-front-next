There are a lot of different aspects of federal support that Deloitte provides, so there is something that could appeal to everyone. Deloitte's benefits are a differentiator for me, the well-being subsidy is first rate and the PTO policy is very flexible, I have never had an issue getting time off when I want or need it - people here are very understanding of work-life balance. To that point, I think they navigated flexible work well throughout the pandemic and did a really good job making sure employees were comfortable. I still work from home (very common amongst the people I speak with regularly) and Deloitte has done a lot in making it a comfortable experience. This is specific to the Government and Public Sector (GPS) practice, but I personally find the work to be dull. The work is very mission-driven and has real world impacts to people across the US (and world), which I really like. However, the scale of the projects sometimes feel so large that it doesn't really feel like you are making as much of an impact. This could be a feature of just working for a really large company, but if you are someone who really wants to see the tangible outcomes of your work I am not sure this is the place.",

Hard work or knowledge or skill doesn't help: If you're not a smart/smooth talker, you have to be a brown-noser to survive at Deloitte. If you're a brown-noser, you can get away with anything.\nConsulting Job expectation is like an old-school Sales Job: If you can sell crap packaged in a beautiful deck (that's the adjective a manager specifically uses to describe powerpoint slides: beautiful) and say a barely coherent story while presenting the decks with extreme confidence, you would be hailed as the best employee by your manager. If you can't beautify powerpoint slides and sell crap, forget about it, you'll be demoted/released from project and every manager who wants to take you on the next project will be forewarned by your current manager. Amazing example of negativity networking.\nMentoring: New hires are neither respected nor recognized. There's no real mentoring or direction or guidance provided for new hires on the next steps in the project etc., instead you get more of the same sales talk during your mentoring sessions, which is completely useless. Though, this sales talk does include veiled verbal threats reminding you of the consequence of challenging the performance rating provided.\nGender Bias: If you end up working with a male chauvinistic manager, you can forget about growth, gender bias is quite prevalent.\nDE&I: Diversity, Equality and Inclusion exists only in policies, not practiced in reality.\nDefensive approach: Documentation created or maintained during the project lifecycle is only used for defending Deloitte, not actually helpful to the customers. More defensive documentation than customer-centric/useful.\nLeading Practices: In the name of industry leading practices, Deloitte recommends impractical solutions to the customers. These solutions are formulated in such a way that Deloitte internal teams can get away with doing minimal work and they save resource costs. These result in complicated solutions that make the customer's life harder than it was while they used their legacy applications/solutions.",

No support from the org if you stuck with any visa issue(like visa stamping) in another country. You will be put in loss of pay category until your visa issue is resolved and you return to work. Because of compliance issue, you cannot work remotely in any other country apart from where you are hired.

Expecting that there will be travel expectation for the weeks you have to be at client site, but I think the WFH the remaining weeks will carry forward. - The team is INCREDIBLY oversold on projects. There is not enough staffing on any of them and so those that ARE staffed on projects have to pick up the slack and take on extra work. I would say I work 50-60 hour weeks sometimes, especially on projects where there’s an expectation of collaboration with global teams.\n- Beyond like super dry trainings that you won’t retain well because there’s no practical application opportunities immediately, there’s like no training for this job. All the trainings you have to do when you join are for tax accountants and have nothing to do with what your job will require.\n- Unless you’re in one of the cities with a large team presence there, you will feel pretty isolated from the rest of the team, and very isolated from the rest of Deloitte as a whole.

It's a definition of a toxic workplace. Managers can lie to you to to make you accept a project which can turn out to be completely irrelevant to your skills and interests and they will never release you. If you complain - expect retaliation through your performance review. They do have HR process for cases above, but most people don't want to deal with it or are afraid to get themselves into bigger trouble. This is why they have such huge employee turnover. They try to retain people by offering signing bonuses that you have to pay back if you leave before reaching 2-year tenure, so some people choose to stay just to avoid this penalty. Another terrible thing - they don't deliver anything useful to clients, you can spend a whole year on a project without being able to follow any best practices or delivering any meaningful work - the way it works is they agree to anything clients say without actually CONSULTING them and then keep telling everything is going well (client don't usually check the work) and continue charging them - everything is about money only. I don't believe this will last long. Pay is also way below market. If you care about your career and your mental health, want to improve your skills or learn something new - avoid this place at all costs.",

I gained a valuable credential that significantly enhanced my career and earnings potential. Some teams within Deloitte can be a lot of fun to work with. Objectively bad benefits, compensation and horrid retirement unless you make the partnership. I worked on a large IT project that was constantly missing milestones because of incompetence, lack of experience, and poor leadership. PPMDs didn't seem to be very present or have much, if any technology experience. There are frankly too many MBAs and consultants instead of experienced professionals. My direct lead was toxic and constantly derailing morning meetings to interrogate me in front of our team among other issues. They later left the project but seemed like a byproduct of Deloitte's \"culture\" as this behavior existed elsewhere in the company. There were also multiple instances of senior employees throwing other people under the bus to cover up large mistakes.\n\nThe company itself is a failure from a diversity & inclusion perspective. Deloitte's talent models are basically a discrimination based system where Deloitte Consulting is obviously mostly ivy league types where those from other backgrounds usually end up in Delivery Center or Project Delivery (PDM). PDM is more like being a sub-contractor to Deloitte and you will miss out on many benefits. It's frankly awkward when your colleagues get to go to Deloitte University but you cannot.\n\nSome might read into this as me just not being Deloitte material, and honestly I don't know who would want to embody the leadership I experienced. These failures ultimately showed in the terrible delivery on my project and constant contract turmoil. Outside of the project I was on, I'm sure there are better places to be within Deloitte however I suspect the culture I experienced is present elsewhere. While I do not regret what I gained from the experience, working here was my most unenjoyable experience in ten years.",

Deloitte University is an amazing place to visit and learn. You also get free access to Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, WSJ subscription, Fortune Magazine subscription\n- Very talented teammates: I'm frequently blown away by how smart, nice, and hard-working my colleagues and supervisors are. Of course you will meet some rude and incompetent people, but they are the exceptions. I made some real meaningful friendships throughout my time at Deloitte\n- Variety of work: Advisory has a bunch of different services. You can move around and find new projects that challenge and stimulate you. But you have to actively do that. Otherwise, you'll be placed on projects purely based on business needs - Not the best work-life balance for commercial practice. Federal/GPS professionals get much better work-life balance\n- Pay is decent but not great. Most Deloitte professionals can jump to a different job and get higher pay. In fact, many people have left for big tech (e.g., Google, Amazon, etc.), other consulting firms (e.g., McKinsey, Accenture, etc.), or industry\n- Deloitte is huge (95,000+ professionals as of this writing) and you can feel like a cog in the machine. You have to speak up and fight for yourself to get staffed on projects that you like",

There were multiple occassions where I expressed frustration with the team effort, bandwith and staffing issues; all were ignored until it was too late (my departure from the company). My project was so understaffed that it was so hard to take PTO for more than a day.

The top level management folks are extremely smart and have a great sense of vision and planning. If you go to company social events (which are very frequent by the way), it is quite easy to have conversations with upper management people (Partners). \n\nDeloitte's hiring pattern is very consistent. For the young starters, they hire smart, well spoken, and subtly aggressive candidates. They have excellent training and knowledge management. They have a well oiled and empowered HR and Tech Support group. Things get done pretty fast. \n\nTheir paid time off program is really great, and pretty straight forward. No messing about.\n\nThey have a big social responsibility program that encourages volunteering. It also presents a great opportunity for youngsters to take event organizing responsibilities. This can be very very useful. Once, I volunteered for an event where we painted rooms for an orphanage center. There was a young guy who did the organizing. We were 10-12 people, with 3 senior executives actually doing paintwork. Quite unique. \n\n\nI have personally seen that Deloitte's top talents tend to start young, spend a 3-4 years, then take a hiatus to pursue a Graduate Degree (typically an MBA). The firm sometimes re-hires these consultants after their MBA with generous financial incentives. They offer much better packages to folks graduating from top universities. Sometimes they can offer huge joining bonuses. \n\nI worked in the IT consulting division.They tend to get top-end projects. On projects, the average age seems pretty low.  A lot of 20-somethings, then there are a handful of 30-40 year old people and some senior Management folks.\n\nBeginner salaries can be a bit low. (which is expected. It takes some time to build credibility in the Consulting business)\n\nOverall, a great place to start your professional career. If you pay attention, you will get seasoned very quickly. Work-life balance can become poor, especially during tight project timelines (This is expected in the Consulting Business). The employees have a significant amount of \"firm-internal\" training and knowledge contribution tasks. There are annual goal expectations. It can get tedious if you continuously work on high demand projects.\n\nThere is intense competition, especially during targeted promotion/milestone years. There can be some backstabbing. It's part of the experience. It is not as bad as it sounds, and seems manageable. \n\nA lot of times, being young and inexperienced has it's flaws. The company has a simple way of seasoning consultants. They get pushed into high pressure situations, and they learn fast, and quickly start managing their own work. But they tend to be blind towards intricate details, especially in complicated IT product implementations. This has an interesting effect. If someone is able to do the hands-on work, everyone else tries to piggy-back on that person for their actual work. The hands-on guy gets overwhelmed, and others try to use him/her as a key resource. \n-- I personally went through a crunch project, and found a number of people \"managing expectations\" (piggy backing), while a handful of people actually knew the end-to-end solution and did the hands-on work. \nThis created a lot more work and mental anguish than needed. Because of the expressed pressure, the hands-on guys have a hard time building and growing their reputation and subsequent performance evaluation rating. This also affects the project execution timelines.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you thoroughly read through your employment agreement and understand the implications. In recent years, they have started hiring for specific projects ONLY. This falls under a particular \"AMS service line\". In this case, if your assigned project gets into a problem, you are exposed to the risk of employment termination. \nTheir HR and Management are very helpful, and they will try to get you a new project. But there are several constraints like location, your skills, and limited time. I went through this, and it was somewhat unnerving. This was one of the reasons I ended up leaving the company.",

Everyone that I work with and have worked with in the past has been extremely communicative and responsive. I can't think of many cons to working at Deloitte.

One pro of consulting in general is that the project-based nature of the work means that if you don't like a certain project, manager, team member, etc. there is usually a light at the end of the tunnel and you don't have to deal with it forever. Deloitte is also really trying to improve the employee experience...this has had mixed results in my experience so far - for example, rolling out the \"hybrid\" model has been great, but keeping work hours reasonable has been less so. But I do think they're trying... There are some fundamental, structural issues at Deloitte that will make meaningful cultural improvements difficult if not impossible. These have not yet forced me to leave, partly because I am sure they exist other places as well, but may ultimately be deciding factors. 1. At a certain level, sales are rewarded above all else. What this means is that there is little accountability for leaders to actually - like, lead. The inconsistencies at the leadership (SM+) level are appalling. 2. Project margin is also highly rewarded. In practice, that means under-staffing projects. This is why work-life balance will never be a thing at Deloitte - it's just simply not incentivized. To get working hours to a consistently reasonable level, Deloitte would have to adequately staff projects, and thus make less profit, which is as likely as hell freezing over.",

That is certainly a pro and brings peace of mind. First, when I signed the contract with Deloitte, back when I was still in university, I was not told that I would be aligned to working on SAP day in and day out. Unfortunately, I was told about this 3 months later when it was too late to look for another job. Many people enjoy SAP and if that is you then wonderful, I happen to despise it. So, not being told about my alignment for months causes a feeling of bait and switch, there is a good chance I would not have signed had I known that. In Hindsight it can be argued this was a mistake made by a young college kid who did not know to ask for clarity on precisely what I would be doing. Nonetheless, Deloitte did a very poor job of communicating alignment. Further, now 4 months in, I have found it rather difficult to move laterally into any other aspect of consulting. The internal structure creates a feeling of being pigeonholed into wherever you are originally slotted. What I mean by this is that I am clawing tooth and nail simply to find a point of contact to help me move out of SAP. Not to actually move, but just to find someone to talk to about moving. For a company which markets itself as caring about employees more than the average, this stonewalling and difficulty in movement has come as a shock to me.",

Deloitte's benefits are a differentiator for me, the well-being subsidy is first rate and the PTO policy is very flexible, I have never had an issue getting time off when I want or need it - people here are very understanding of work-life balance. To that point, I think they navigated flexible work well throughout the pandemic and did a really good job making sure employees were comfortable. I still work from home (very common amongst the people I speak with regularly) and Deloitte has done a lot in making it a comfortable experience. This is specific to the Government and Public Sector (GPS) practice, but I personally find the work to be dull. The work is very mission-driven and has real world impacts to people across the US (and world), which I really like. However, the scale of the projects sometimes feel so large that it doesn't really feel like you are making as much of an impact. This could be a feature of just working for a really large company, but if you are someone who really wants to see the tangible outcomes of your work I am not sure this is the place.",

The consulting structure affords you the opportunity to move between projects, which keeps the burn-out at bay without the stress of finding new employment. Because the USDC is Deloitte's \"on-shore offshoring\", you are a second class citizen to \"core\" Deloitte. Benefits are not as strong, for example: pay is roughly 25% lower on average; core employees receive 16 weeks of baby leave, while USDC new hires receive 2 weeks; there is no pension program; I believe PTO is accrued slightly slower; you do not attend Deloitte's \"university\". Core employees are generally unaware of these differences. In some cases, core employees will treat USDC as \"the help.\"",

In my personal experience, this has been excellent: less time traveling, more time spent with my family, and I feel like I'm delivering better work at the end of the day because I'm happier and have more energy. As a developer, I feel like my time at Deloitte is limited. There isn't a dedicated path forward for technical people who want to remain on the traditional consulting track; all senior positions seem to come with some form of sales requirements or general management.",

So I can't say much to Audit, Tax, or Consulting\n- World class training: Deloitte offers many in-person (pre COVID) and online courses on technical knowledge and soft skills. Deloitte University is an amazing place to visit and learn. You also get free access to Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, WSJ subscription, Fortune Magazine subscription\n- Very talented teammates: I'm frequently blown away by how smart, nice, and hard-working my colleagues and supervisors are. Of course you will meet some rude and incompetent people, but they are the exceptions. I made some real meaningful friendships throughout my time at Deloitte\n- Variety of work: Advisory has a bunch of different services. You can move around and find new projects that challenge and stimulate you. But you have to actively do that. Otherwise, you'll be placed on projects purely based on business needs - Not the best work-life balance for commercial practice. Federal/GPS professionals get much better work-life balance\n- Pay is decent but not great. Most Deloitte professionals can jump to a different job and get higher pay. In fact, many people have left for big tech (e.g., Google, Amazon, etc.), other consulting firms (e.g., McKinsey, Accenture, etc.), or industry\n- Deloitte is huge (95,000+ professionals as of this writing) and you can feel like a cog in the machine. You have to speak up and fight for yourself to get staffed on projects that you like",

Consulting is not a great lifestyle to raise a family. \n Remote has been difficult and there is a growing norm to always be on. It is common for emails at 12:30 am and all weekend long. The pay is great, but the hours you work are long and probably not very comparable to a decent-paying 9-5 if you looked at it from an hourly rate. There is also not an emphasis on developing people since there is a line out the door to work here. You have to be proactive if you want to be developed.

As a transfer pricing senior manager in the Tysons, VA offices of Deloitte, I found myself immersed in a toxic culture of aloofness, narcissism, paranoia, and despair. The partners generally appear to hate one another, and treat each other as rivals. One in particular suffers obvious symptoms of mental disturbance, most likely narcissistic personality disorder. (Example: Her standard engagement letter actually includes braggadocio about her years as a Ph.D. student and her professional awards. What striking insecurity!) More generally, there is an endless rhetorical barrage about the importance of expressing honest disagreement and respect for diversity of opinion. That is nothing but institutional gaslighting. They are trying to get you to deny the reality that the only way to succeed is to agree with management, no matter how unethical, disrespectful, or ignorant their decisions might be.",

For some of these people, their contributions saved young project managers from disaster to then have the same PM give high ratings to defect riddled, slow practitioners that were in their 20s and early 30s.
